This is the code associated with my final project for Neuro-140.

The datasets were not added to the github repository, but they can be regenerated using shape_gen.py

The file functional.py includes the main code for training the models on the standard versions of left or right and seen or not.

The files functional_omni.py and functional_omni_lr.py are responsible for building the models for the Omniglot versions of the 1 memory game and left or right, respectively.

The file shape_mem_encoder.py contains the code used to train the encoder network.

The visuals folders contains all of the figures for the project, which were generated with visualizations.py.

Other files include code that did not end up in the file project, including a test of the games using an LSTM module, and a test of the game using an Echo State Network.
